8. What is your biggest achievement so far?

Answer:

"My biggest achievement so far was successfully leading a team project during my final year at university. We were tasked with developing a machine learning model to detect objects within an image. As the team leader, I coordinated the efforts of three team members, divided the tasks based on individual abilities.

One of the major challenges we faced was dealing with incomplete and noisy data. I took the initiative to research and implement data cleaning and preprocessing techniques, which significantly improved the quality of our dataset. I also guided the team in selecting and tuning the appropriate machine learning algorithms, leading to a model with high accuracy.

Our project was well-received by our professors and was selected for presentation at a regional tech symposium. This experience taught me valuable lessons in leadership, teamwork, and problem-solving, and it reinforced my passion for AI/ML and data science. I believe this achievement demonstrates my ability to handle complex projects and work effectively with others to achieve common goals."
